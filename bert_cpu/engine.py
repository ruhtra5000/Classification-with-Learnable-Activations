"""Tensor-based reverse-mode autodiff engine.

This module implements a NumPy-backed successor to micrograd's [1] scalar
``Value`` class. A ``Tensor`` wraps an ``np.ndarray`` and records the operations
applied to it so that gradients can be computed by reverse-mode automatic
differentiation.

The core autograd machinery is identical in spirit to micrograd: the engine
builds a computational graph, sorts it topologically, and calls each node's
``_backward`` closure in reverse order. The main difference is that each node
now stores a whole NumPy array rather than a single scalar value.

In micrograd, arithmetic is performed through Python-level scalar
operations, and a vector or matrix computation would be represented as many
small scalar nodes. In this tensor-based engine, operations such as elementwise
multiplication, reductions, broadcasting, and matrix multiplication are
represented as single graph nodes, while the underlying numerical computation
is delegated to NumPy's optimized compiled backend.

This makes the graph more compact and brings the implementation closer to the
design of real deep learning frameworks, where graph nodes usually represent
tensor operations rather than individual scalar operations.

# The engine uses ``default_dtype`` to control the numerical precision used

    """Seed the single, library-wide NumPy random number generator.

    All randomness in the project — parameter initialization, dataset
    shuffling, token masking, dropout, and negative sampling — flows through
    NumPy's *global* random state (the ``np.random.*`` functions, which is also
    what ``randn`` below uses). Seeding that one source therefore makes the
    whole experiment reproducible. Centralizing these sources of randomness
    makes experiments easier to reproduce and helps researchers compare model
    variants under more controlled conditions.

    As discussed by Pham et al. [2] and Chen et al. [3], the interaction between
    software-level randomness and hardware-level** nondeterminism, using regular
    Deep Learning frameworks, makes it difficult to determine whether an observed
    performance change was caused by a proposed architectural or algorithmic 
    modification or merely by uncontrolled experimental variation. Centralizing 
    the explicit sources of randomness in a single NumPy generator therefore helps
    researchers conduct more controlled comparisons during early prototyping. 
    
    **GPUs are widely used for deep learning training because their large number of 
    processing cores enables substantial parallelism. However, this parallel execution 
    can also introduce nondeterminism in floating-point computations. Floating-point 
    operations are affected by rounding and are not mathematically associative in 
    finite precision; therefore, different execution or reduction orders may lead to
    small numerical differences across runs [2, 4].


    Parameters
    ----------
    seed:
        Integer used to initialize NumPy's pseudo-random number generator.
        Reusing the same seed reproduces the same random sequence, provided
        that random operations are executed in the same order.

    How to use it
    -------------
    Call it **once, at the very start**, before creating any tensors or data;

        import bert_cpu
        bert_cpu.set_seed(0)        # same seed -> identical run every time
        x = bert_cpu.randn(3, 4)    # reproducible

    Call ``set_seed`` again with another value for a different but equally
    repeatable run; omit it entirely for a fresh random run.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The seed is applied to NumPy's global random state in place.

def _expand_reduced(grad: np.ndarray, axis: Axis, keepdims: bool, target_shape: Tuple[int, ...]) -> np.ndarray:

    """Expand a reduction's upstream gradient back to the input shape.

    Consider the gradient of ``(w.T @ x).sum()``. Let ``z = w.T @ x`` be an array
    with shape ``(2, 3)`` (e.g. ``w`` is ``(2, 2)`` and ``x`` is ``(2, 3)``), and
    let ``out = z.sum()`` be a scalar:

        z = w.T @ x = [ z00  z01  z02 ]    out = z.sum()
                      [ z10  z11  z12 ]

        out = z00 + z01 + z02 + z10 + z11 + z12 

    Because ``out`` is the sum of every element of ``z``, each element has local
    derivative:

        d out / d z_ij = 1.

    When ``out.backward()`` is called, the engine populates ``out.grad`` with the
    upstream gradient. See ``Tensor.sum`` for the derivative rule used to compute
    ``d out / d z`` when ``out = z.sum()``. 
    
    To obtain the gradient with respect to ``z``, this scalar
    must be expanded to the same shape as ``z``. Since every element of ``z`` has
    local derivative 1, the upstream gradient is repeated across all positions
    using NumPy broadcasting [5]. For an upstream gradient equal to 1:

        np.broadcast_to(grad, (2, 3)) = [ 1  1  1 ]
                                        [ 1  1  1 ]

    More generally, if the upstream scalar were ``g``, every element would receive
    ``g``.

    This is a full reduction because ``axis is None``. No reduced axes need to be
    reinserted before broadcasting the scalar to the original input shape.

    For a partial reduction, the removed dimensions must first be restored. For
    example, ``z.sum(axis=1)`` collapses the three columns and produces an output
    with shape ``(2,)``. Its upstream gradient also has shape ``(2,)``. Before it
    can be broadcast to ``z``'s shape, axis 1 is reinserted with
    ``np.expand_dims``, producing shape ``(2, 1)``:

        grad.shape                         -> (2,)
        np.expand_dims(grad, axis=1)       -> (2, 1)
        np.broadcast_to(grad, (2, 3))      -> (2, 3)

    This restores the gradient shape required by the input of the reduction.

    The ``keepdims`` flag decides whether that first step is needed. With
    ``keepdims=True`` the reduced axis is *kept* as a size-1 dimension (e.g.
    ``z.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)`` already has shape ``(2, 1)``), so the
    gradient is already aligned with the input and ``np.expand_dims`` is skipped
    — only the broadcast runs. The reinsertion therefore happens exactly when an
    axis was reduced *and* dropped, i.e. ``axis is not None and not keepdims``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grad : np.ndarray
        Upstream gradient, carrying the reduction's (smaller) output shape.
    axis : int, tuple of int, or None
        Axis/axes that were reduced; ``None`` means a full reduction.
    keepdims : bool
        Whether the reduction kept the reduced axes as size-1 dimensions.
    target_shape : tuple of int
        Shape of the reduction's input — the shape to expand the gradient to.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        ``grad`` expanded (re-inserted if needed, then broadcast) to
        ``target_shape``.

class Tensor:
    """An n-dimensional array node in the autograd computational graph.

    For an accessible introduction to computational graphs, see Andrew Ng's
    explanation here: https://youtu.be/hCP1vGoCdYU?si=DvIRDH0MucRckYcU 
    
    A ``Tensor`` stores both a numerical value and the information required to
    propagate gradients through the operation that created it. Tensors may be
    leaf nodes, such as model parameters and inputs, or intermediate nodes
    produced by arithmetic operations.

    Consider the expression:

        out = (w.T @ x).sum()

    where ``@`` is **matrix multiplication** — the linear-algebra row-by-column
    product, *not* the elementwise ``*`` — and ``wᵀ`` is the transpose of ``w``.
    The ``wᵀ @ x`` form is the usual way to write a linear layer. (For matrices
    ``A`` and ``B``, ``A @ B`` requires the inner dimensions to match:
    ``(m, k) @ (k, n) -> (m, n)``.) With ``w`` of shape ``(2, 2)`` and ``x`` of
    shape ``(2, 3)``, ``z = wᵀ @ x`` has shape ``(2, 3)``. The engine constructs
    the following computational graph:

        ● out          (sum -> scalar)
        └─ ● z          (@ -> shape (2, 3))
           ├─ ● w
           └─ ● x

    Here, ``z = wᵀ @ x`` is an intermediate ``Tensor`` whose parent nodes are
    ``w`` and ``x``. The scalar ``out`` is another ``Tensor``, created by
    reducing all elements of ``z``.

    When ``out.backward()`` is called, the engine seeds ``out.grad`` with 1,
    corresponding to:

        d out / d out = 1

    It then traverses the graph in reverse topological order. The ``sum`` node
    uses ``_expand_reduced`` to restore the reduced dimensions and broadcast its
    upstream gradient back to ``z.shape``. The matmul node then applies the
    chain rule: each input's gradient is the upstream gradient ``d out / d z``
    times that input's local slope of ``z``:

        d out / d x = (d out / d z) · (d z / d x),   with   d z / d x = w
        d out / d w = (d out / d z) · (d z / d w),   with   d z / d w = x

    Written so the matrix shapes line up, those products are:

        d out / d x = w @ (d out / d z)
        d out / d w = x @ (d out / d z).T

    The backward (derivative) rule for each operation lives in its own method:
    see ``Tensor.__matmul__`` for the matrix multiplication and ``Tensor.sum``
    for the sum.

    The resulting gradients are accumulated in ``x.grad`` and ``w.grad``.
    Gradient accumulation is necessary because the same tensor may contribute
    to the final output through more than one path in the graph.

    Attributes
    ----------
    data : np.ndarray
        Numerical value computed. For example, the ``data`` stored by ``z`` in
        ``z = w.T @ x`` is the matrix product of ``w.data.T`` and ``x.data``.

    grad : np.ndarray
        Gradient of the final scalar output, ``out``, with respect to this
        tensor's ``data``. It has the same shape as ``data`` and is initialized
        to zeros.

        Gradient contributions are accumulated with addition rather than
        overwritten because the same tensor may influence ``out`` through
        multiple paths in the computational graph. For example, consider:

            out = x**2 + 3 * x

        The tensor ``x`` contributes to ``out`` through two paths. Drawing the
        graph the way the ``learn`` walkthroughs do (output on top, operands
        hanging below), ``x`` is reached twice — once under each path:

            ● out          (the + node)
            ├─ ● x²         (the **2 node)
            │  └─ ● x
            └─ ● 3·x        (the * node)
               └─ ● x       ⤴ (the same x as above)

        By the sum rule, the total derivative with respect to ``x`` is the sum
        of the derivative contributions from both paths:

            d out / d x = d(x**2) / d x + d(3x) / d x
                        = 2x + 3

        During the backward pass, each path therefore adds its contribution to
        ``x.grad``:

            x.grad += 2 * x.data
            x.grad += 3

        If gradients were overwritten instead of accumulated, the contribution
        from one path would replace the contribution from the other. Accumulation
        ensures that ``x.grad`` stores the complete derivative obtained from all
        paths connecting ``x`` to ``out``.


    requires_grad : bool
        Whether this tensor should accumulate gradients. When ``False``, the
        tensor is treated as a constant during the backward pass.

    _backward : Callable[[], None]
        Closure containing the local derivative rule for the operation that
        created this tensor.

        The gradient stored in this tensor is the upstream gradient received from
        the next operation in the computational graph. In other words, if this
        tensor is ``z``, then ``self.grad`` represents:

            d out / d z

        where ``out`` is the final scalar output. The closure combines this
        upstream gradient with the local derivatives of the operation that created
        ``z`` and accumulates the resulting contributions into the parent tensors.

        For example, consider:

            z = w.T @ x

        In the closure stored in ``z._backward``, ``self`` refers to ``z``.
        Therefore:

            self.grad == z.grad == d out / d z

        Applying the chain rule gives:

            d out / d x = (d z / d x) @ (d out / d z)
            d out / d w = (d z / d w) @ (d out / d z)

        For compatible vector and matrix shapes, the closure conceptually performs:

            x.grad += w.data @ z.grad
            w.grad += np.outer(x.data, z.grad)

        Thus, ``z.grad`` controls how strongly the local derivatives of the
        matrix-multiplication operation contribute to the gradients of ``x`` and
        ``w``. These contributions are accumulated because the same parent tensor
        may influence the final output through multiple paths.



    _prev : set[Tensor]
        Parent tensors used to create this tensor. For ``z = wᵀ @ x``,
        ``z._prev`` contains ``w`` and ``x``. Leaf tensors normally have no
        parents.

    _op : str
        Human-readable label for the operation that created this tensor, such
        as ``"*"``, ``"+"``, ``"@"``, or ``"sum"``. It is used for debugging and
        computational-graph visualization.

    The forward value is just ``np.concatenate``; the interesting part is the

    *places* each input's values into a contiguous slice of the output. So for
    ``out = cat([A, B], axis=0)`` the upstream gradient ``out.grad`` is simply
    **cut back into the same slices** and handed to each input unchanged:

        A ── row block 0 ──┐

    There is no local derivative to multiply by (it is the identity on each

    row ``x_0 = 1`` to an input lets the gradient w.r.t. the real features flow
    straight back through the corresponding slice, while the constant row (a
    ``requires_grad=False`` tensor) is ignored.
